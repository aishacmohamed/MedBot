## Problem Statement
Medical professionals are often overworked and overburdened, which increases the risk of medication errors. These errors can endanger patients‚Äô lives and affect healthcare workers‚Äô careers.  

MedBot automates the process of medication delivery:
- Starts at its **home dock**
- Moves to the **pharmacist** to pick up medications
- Delivers to the **patient**
- Avoids obstacles by backing up, redirecting, and playing a sound to notify nearby people

This solution reduces user errors, lowers workload stress, and enhances overall accuracy.

---

## Narrative
Medication errors are the most common and preventable cause of patient injury. MedBot aims to mitigate risks by:
- Automating **prescription pickup** from the pharmacy
- Delivering directly to the **correct patient**
- Providing **safe rerouting** in case of unexpected obstacles

By reducing repetitive tasks, MedBot allows healthcare workers to spend more time on direct patient care.
